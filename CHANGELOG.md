# Changelog

All notable changes to TrollVNC are documented here.

# 3.4-280

- Drain interleaved presence commands until the matching heartbeat ACK arrives.
- Prevent queued ACK packets from starving later Lua commands and causing false
  background-channel timeout errors.

# 3.4-279

- Carry Lua run and health commands over the persistent outbound presence
  connection when iOS power saving blocks new inbound HTTP connections.
- Keep wake and automation available without lighting the display periodically.

# 3.4-278

- Add a persistent two-way TCP presence channel to the Windows Controller.
- Shorten UDP keepalive to two seconds and validate Controller acknowledgements.
- Keep all network keepalive independent from HID events so a sleeping display
  is not flashed or unlocked.

## [3.2] – 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Bind Address**: The VNC server can now be bound to a specific local IP address. Leave empty to listen on all interfaces. Validation is performed in the app UI before applying.
- **Orientation Correction** (formerly *Apply Orientation Fix*): Replaced the on/off toggle with a four-option selector — 0° (Default), 90° Clockwise, 180°, and Counterclockwise 90°. Useful for iPad models with non-standard default orientations.
- **Subscription Reconnection**: The client list now automatically reconnects to the VNC server daemon with exponential backoff (1s → 30s cap) and TCP keep-alive, recovering gracefully from server restarts.
- **Simulator Sandbox Support**: `sim-spawn.sh` now forwards the simulator sandbox path as an environment variable so the server reads preferences from the correct location during development. Logs are tee’d to both the terminal and the sandbox tmp directory.

### Changed
- Xcode app target now reads and writes preferences via the daemon’s sandbox path when running in the simulator.

### Fixed
- Version check now falls back gracefully on older iOS versions where the system API is unavailable.
- Fixed a short-read bug in `TVNCReadAll`: data is now read until EOF or timeout instead of stopping early on a partial buffer.
- Fixed subscription handshake validation: the server response is now checked to contain “OK” before the client list is considered live; an invalid response triggers an immediate reconnect.
- Fixed `TVNCSliderCell` reuse bugs: `prepareForReuse` resets the slider to `minimumValue`, and `refreshCellContentsWithSpecifier:` fully re-applies `min`/`max`/`format`/`isContinuous` from the incoming specifier.
# 3.4-277

- Add a LAN-only `/install_update` API for bulk TrollStore updates.
- Only accept an update URL whose host matches the requesting Controller IP.
- Launch TrollStore directly with its official `apple-magnifier://install` URL.
- Add a watchdog-assisted restart API so the newly installed Agent binary becomes active.

# 3.3-276

- Keep the iPhone network route alive with an outbound UDP heartbeat every 5 seconds.
- Remember the latest Windows Controller address and receive an acknowledgement on UDP 46954.
- Always execute screen wake instead of trusting the lock-state API as display-power state.
- Use a real HID Power event for `device.sleep()` on passcode-free iOS 15 devices.

# 3.2-275

- Fix a daemon crash in `screen.find_image` by matching against a fresh immutable
  capture instead of reading a framebuffer while the capture thread swaps it.

# 3.2-274

- Add `app.run_shortcut(name)` to run an Apple Shortcut by its exact name without
  relying on its grid position.

# 3.2-273

- Add UDP discovery on port 46953 for XXTouch Controller auto scan.
- Capture a fresh screen frame on demand for `/snapshot` without requiring a VNC client.
- Stop on-demand capture after the JPEG is created when no VNC client is connected.
